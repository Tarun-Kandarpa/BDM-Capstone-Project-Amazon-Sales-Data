## Amazon Sales & Fulfillment: Data-Driven Insights for Optimization & Growth

The project focuses on analyzing Amazon’s e-commerce operations data and addressing the 
key challenges in order fulfillment, cancellations, logistics, and promotional strategies. One 
of the major business challenges arises from the high order cancellation rate, along with 
inefficiencies in fulfillment, shipping delays, and ineffective promotional strategies. These 
factors not only lead to revenue loss but also reduce customer satisfaction and cause logistical 
inefficiencies. 
To address these challenges, the project will use various analytical approaches such as data 
cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy, data visualization through graphs and charts 
for clear insights, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends in cancellations, 
order fulfillment, logistics, and pricing. Moreover, statistical and predictive analytics will also 
be employed to forecast demand, optimize inventory levels, and improve seller performance. 
The expected outcome is to reduce order cancellations, enhance logistical efficiency, and 
improve promotional effectiveness. By optimizing fulfillment strategies, the project will 
enhance customer satisfaction, thereby improving Amazon’s competitive position and driving 
higher sales performance. Ensuring efficient stock management and reducing delivery delays 
as well as transportation problems will help Amazon maintain excellent operations, ensuring 
smooth business performance and sustainable growth.
